**User Service**
Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management. Below are the basic steps to execute the first service:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create the **User Service**:

#### 1. **Setup Your Development Environment**:
   - **Node.js & Express**: We will use **Node.js** as the runtime environment and **Express.js** as the web framework to create the User Service.
   - **Database**: Choose a database for storing user details. For simplicity, we’ll use **MongoDB** as it integrates well with Node.js.
   - **Package Manager**: Use **npm** or **yarn** to manage dependencies.

   **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. You can check this using the following commands:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

   **Install MongoDB**:
   - If you are using **local MongoDB**, make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.
   - Alternatively, you can use cloud-based services like **MongoDB Atlas** for a managed database.

#### 2. **Create a New Directory for User Service**:
   - Create a new directory for the **User Service**:
     ```bash
     mkdir user-service
     cd user-service
     ```
   - Initialize a new **Node.js** project:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

#### 3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Install **Express**, **Mongoose** (for MongoDB interaction), **bcryptjs** (for password hashing), **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** for token-based authentication, and **dotenv** to manage environment variables:
     ```bash
     npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv
     ```

#### 4. **Create Project Structure**:
   Set up a basic folder structure for your User Service:
   ```
   user-service/
   ├── controllers/
   ├── models/
   ├── routes/
   ├── .env
   ├── server.js
   ├── config/
   ```

   - **controllers/**: This will contain the logic for handling requests.
   - **models/**: Contains MongoDB schema definitions (User schema).
   - **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints for the service.
   - **config/**: For configuration files (like database connection).
   - **.env**: For environment variables such as database credentials.
